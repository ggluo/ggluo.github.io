I'm currently doing my Ph.D. in computer science at University of GÃ¶ttingen. Throughout my Ph.D. journey since 2020, I have been working closely with [Prof. Dr. Martin Uecker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r7BG-ZYAAAAJ&hl=en), a renowned expert in the field of MR image reconstruction, who is associated with both [IBI](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ibi/institute/team/) at Graz University of Technology and the department of radiology at [University Medical Center GÃ¶ttingen](https://radiologie.umg.eu/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/kardiovaskulaere-mrt-forschung-computational-mri-ag-uecker/).

My academic background overlaps machine learning, magnetic resonance imaging, signal/image processing, optimization and inverse problems. 
I am truly passionate about remaining at the intersection of these fields and driving innovation along with fellow researchers from the sides of both MR and machine learning. Feel free to explore my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) to learn more about me.

Over the past five years, I have been actively working on MR image reconstruction with generative models. Feel free to check my [projects](/projects/) page. 
You will find I have used python, C/C++, shell and Latex in my projects on [ggluo](https://github.com/ggluo)@github. I have spent much time with JAX/Tensorflow/Pytorch.


Apart from my research, I love soccer, tennis, and photography.
