I am an independent researcher. I have been working on diffusion and generative modeling for solving complex inverse problems in imaging and signal reconstruction. My work explores how self-diffusion processes and autoregressive diffusion architectures can recover high-fidelity images from degraded observations while providing principled uncertainty estimation.

My previous projects bridge deep generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and optimization, developing models that move seamlessly from theory to deployment. Using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorRT, I build full-stack systems that make cutting-edge generative methods practical for real-world applications.

Apart from my research, I love soccer, tennis, and photography.
