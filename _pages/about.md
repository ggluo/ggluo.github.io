I am an independent researcher working at the intersection of generative modeling and inverse problems. I maainly focus on computational imaging and signal processing. Improving image quality under limited information is one of my main research interests. My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

Apart from my research, I love soccer, tennis, and photography.
