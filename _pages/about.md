I'm currently doing my Ph.D. in computer science at University of GÃ¶ttingen. Throughout my Ph.D. journey since 2020, I have been working closely with [Prof. Dr. Martin Uecker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r7BG-ZYAAAAJ&hl=en), a renowned expert in the field of MR image reconstruction, who is associated with both [IBI](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ibi/institute/team/) at Graz University of Technology and the department of radiology at [University Medicine Center GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.umg.eu/).

My academic background is machine learning, magnetic resonance imaging, signal/image processing, optimization, inverse problems. 
I am truly passionate about remaining at the intersection of these fields and driving innovation along with fellow researchers from the side of both MR and machine learning. Feel free to explore my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) to learn more about me.

Over the past five year, I have been actively working on MR image reconstruction, closely following the rapid developments in the machine learning community. 
I have developed a Python library for training generative models **[spreco](https://github.com/mrirecon/spreco)**, based on TensorFlow. This library has been used in many of my [projects](/projects/) focused on MR image reconstruction.


Apart from my research, I love soccer, tennis and photography.
