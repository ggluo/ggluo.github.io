**`Overview`**
In recent years, deep learning methods have made significant advancements in fast MRI reconstruction, yielding many promising results. However, challenges are constantly rising. Supervised methods for MR reconstruction are costly because of the collection of [k-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-space_(magnetic_resonance_imaging)) label data and a model for one specific application is hard to apply to other applications. Apart from that, worries about the uncertainty caused by undersampling strategies and deep learning algorithms have limited their usage in clinical practice until now, which could lead to hallucinations. The application of generative image priors is one way out. 

I have been actively developing a Python library, **[spreco](https://pypi.org/project/spreco/)**, for training generative models, based on TensorFlow. With that, I have trained many medical image priors that are hosted on this **[huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/Guanxiong/MRI-Image-Priors)** and used them to address above challenges. Some of my projects are listed below.
