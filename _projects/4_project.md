**`Abstract`** We developed a deep learning-based Bayesian estimation for MRI
reconstruction. The image reconstruction from
incomplete k-space measurement was obtained by maximizing the posterior probability (MAP).
The autoregressive generative model [PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05517) was utilized as the image prior
and the k-space data fidelity was enforced by using an equality constraint.
The stochastic back-propagation was utilized to calculate the descent gradient in the
process of maximum a posterior, and a projected sub-gradient method was used to
impose the equality constraint. In contrast to the other deep learning reconstruction
methods, the proposed one used the likelihood of prior as the training loss and the
objective function in reconstruction to improve the image quality.


**`Method`** There two stages in our approach. The first is to learn prior information from an existing dataset using PixelCNN, and the second is to maximize the posterior using the sub-gradient projection method as illustrated in Figure 2.

With Bayes theorem, one could write the posterior as a product of likelihood and prior:
\begin{equation}
f(x|y) = \frac{f(y\mid x)g(x)}{f(y)}    \propto f(y\mid x )\,g(x )
\label{eq:1}
\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $$f(y\mid x)$$ is probability of the measured k-space data $$ y\in \mathbb{C}^M$$ for a given image $$x\in \mathbb{C}^N$$, $$N$$ is the number of pixels and $$M$$ is the number of measured data points. $$g(x)$$ is the prior model that estimates the distribution of MR images. 
In order to avoid the confusion with the likelihood occurs in modelling the prior, $$f(y\mid x)$$ is referred to as k-space likelihood model.
The image reconstruction is achieved by exploring the posterior $$f(x\mid y)$$ with an appropriate estimator. The maximum a posterior estimation could provide the reconstructed image $$\hat{x}$$ that is given by:
\begin{equation}
{\hat {x }}_{\mathrm {MAP} }(y)={\underset {x}{\operatorname {arg\,max} }}\ f(x \mid y)={\underset {x}{\operatorname {arg\,max} }}\ f(y\mid x)\,g(x)\nonumber
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
In this way, the reconstruction problem is recast as posterior probability calculations.

Specifically, we reconstructed images with 256$$\times$$256 matrix size, using the prior model $$g(x)$$ that was trained with 128$$\times$$128 images. To reconcile this mismatch, we split one 256$$\times$$256 image into four 128$$\times$$128 patches for applying the prior model. After updating $${s}^{(k+1)}$$, four patches for one image were merged to form an image with the original size of 256$$\times$$256. Then the merged image was projected onto $$\{x\mid y  = \mathcal{A} x \ + \ \varepsilon\}$$. Furthermore, the random shift along phase encoding direction was applied to mitigate the stitching line in-between patches. `Figure 3` displays the evolution of image during the process of reconstruction.


**`Conclusion`** The Bayesian estimation significantly improved the reconstruction
performance, compared with the conventional L$$^1$$-sparsity prior
in compressed sensing reconstruction tasks. More importantly, the
learnt prior knowledge is generic to many MRI reconstruction scenarios
when changing sampling patterns, coils and so on.
