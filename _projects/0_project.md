**`TLDR`** Self-diffusion solves inverse problems without the need of pretrained generative models via a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. The full paper is available [here](https://nips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/119840) and the code is available [here](https://github.com/ggluo/self-diffusion).

**`Abstract`** **Self-diffusion** introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers on a clean dataset, this approach still remains adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations.

**`Methods`** To map the estimated noisy solution $$\mathbf{x}_t=\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}_{t} + \sigma(t) \epsilon_t$$ to the true solution $$\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}$$, a self-diffusion process trains a self-denoiser $$D_{\theta_{t,k}}$$ at each noise step $$t = T-1, \ldots, 0$$ over $$k = 0, \ldots, K-1$$ iterations to minimize the loss

\begin{equation}
    L_{t,k} = \| \mathcal{A} D_{\theta_{t,k}}(\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}_{t} + \sigma(t) \epsilon_t) - \mathbf{y} \|^2~,
    \label{eq:loss}
\end{equation}

where $$\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}_{t}$$ is the estimate of $$\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}$$ within noise step $$t$$, initialized as $$\mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}_{T} = \epsilon_0 $$, with $$\epsilon_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$. The noise $$\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$ is sampled once at the start of noise timestep $$ t $$ and is fixed across all $$ K $$ iterations within that timestep. It is then resampled for the next noise step $$ t-1 $$. The noise schedule is $$ \sigma_t = \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t},$$ where $$\bar{\alpha}_t = \mathop{\textstyle\prod}\nolimits_{i=0}^t (1 - \beta_i)$$ and $$\beta_t = \beta_{\text{end}} + \frac{t}{T - 1}(\beta_{\text{start}} - \beta_{\text{end}})$$.
After $$ K $$ iterations at each noise step, the self-denoiser $$ D_{\theta_{t,k}} $$ produce the estimated solution $$ \mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}_{t-1} $$ for the next noise step $$ t-1 $$.
As the noise level $$\sigma(t)$$ decreases to zero, the predicted solution converges to the true solution $$ \mathbf{x}^{\text{true}}$$. Equation \eqref{eq:loss} is expanded into the following form using a first-order Taylor:

\begin{equation}
 \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon\_{t}}[||\mathcal{A}D\_{\theta\_{t,k}}(\mathbf{x}_t)-\mathbf{y}||^{2}] \approx \underbrace{||\mathcal{A}D\_{\theta\_{t,k}}(\mathbf{x}\_t^\text{true})-\mathbf{y}||^2}\_{\text{Data Fidelity Term}} +\underbrace{\sigma(t)^{2}||\mathcal{A}J_D(\mathbf{x}_t^\text{true})||_F^2}\_{\text{Regularization Term}}~.
\end{equation}

This regularization effect is modulated by the noise level $$\sigma_t$$. In early steps of diffusion, where noise is large, the regularization is strong, enforcing smooth outputs and prioritizing low-frequency components. As the process progresses and $$\sigma_t$$ decreases, the regularization weakens, allowing the network to focus on finer, high-frequency details. This design leads to an implicit multi-scale learning regime, where the reconstruction transitions from global structure to local refinement. We reveal this process in Fourier space as detailed in the paper.

**`Results`** As a teaser, we evaluated self-diffusion on a large image of size (5000$$\times$$3000), which is from an inexperienced shooter and corrupted by dust spots and minor noise. We masked the dust spots using a binary mask then restored the image using self-diffusion. Apart from this, we listed some of our results in the paper from different settings such as inpainting, image denoising and MRI reconstruction.
