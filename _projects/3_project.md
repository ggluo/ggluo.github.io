**`Abstract`** 
Building on this previous [project](/projects/4_project/), this work aims to deploy the trained model with an MR image reconstruction toolbox, **[BART](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart)**, which is a versatile framework for image reconstruction. As shown in Figure 1, there are two steps to realize this: (a) export the constructed computation graph with TensorFlow; (b) use the graph as regularization in BART.
We validated the reconstruction pipeline using radial brain scans and the [SENSE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10542355/) model regularized by a log-likelihood image prior.

**`Method`** We developed a Python library for training generative models, **[spreco](https://github.com/mrirecon/spreco)**, based on TensorFlow, which has the following features:
1. Distributed training 
2. Interruptible training
3. Efficient dataloader for medical images
4. Customizable with a configuration file

And we trained a log-likelihood prior, $$\log p({x};\mathtt{NET}(\hat{\Theta}, {x}))$$[$$^1$$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05517), which is used to impose learned prior knowledge of images in the SENSE model. 
The reconstruction is commonly formulated as the following minimization problem
\begin{equation}
    \hat{x}=\underset{x}{\arg\min}\ \|\mathcal{A}{x}-{y}\|_2^2 + \lambda \log p({x};\mathtt{NET}(\hat{\Theta}, {x})),\nonumber
    \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
where the first term ensures data consistency between the acquired [k-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-space_(magnetic_resonance_imaging)) data $${y}$$ and the desired image $${x}$$, $$\mathcal{A}$$ is the forward operator. This problem is solved with [FISTA](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/FISTA) algorithm that has been implemented in BART. To use the learned log-likelihood prior with BART, we have implemented a [wrapper](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart/commit/8b8d4ed2a727bcbc19a11e9ddd64d46f7e5e21d9) using [TensorFlow C API]([$$^1$$](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c)) for the initialization, restoration and inference of the exported trained model.

**`Conclusion`** We showcased the seamless integration of a TensorFlow trained model into the existing MRI reconstruction workflows of the BART toolbox. 
This integration allows us to leverage the image reconstruction capabilities offered by BART while harnessing the advantages of rapid prototyping of advanced deep learning models using TensorFlow.
