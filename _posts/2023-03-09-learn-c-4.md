`std::array` and `std::vector` are both container classes provided by the C++ Standard Library, but they have different characteristics and are used for different purposes:

1. **Size**:
   - **`std::array`**: Has a fixed size determined at compile time, specified by its template parameter. Once created, the size of a `std::array` cannot be changed.
   - **`std::vector`**: Has a dynamic size that can grow or shrink at runtime. Elements can be added or removed from a `std::vector` after it's created.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - **`std::array`**: Typically allocated on the stack. The size of a `std::array` must be known at compile time, so its memory is allocated statically.
   - **`std::vector`**: Typically allocated on the heap. The memory for a `std::vector` is dynamically allocated, allowing it to resize as needed.

3. **Accessing Elements**:
   - **`std::array`**: Supports constant time (O(1)) random access to elements using the `[]` operator. It provides efficient access to elements since the array is contiguous in memory.
   - **`std::vector`**: Supports constant time (O(1)) random access to elements using the `[]` operator. Like `std::array`, it provides efficient access to elements due to its contiguous memory layout.

4. **Performance**:
   - **`std::array`**: Typically offers better performance than `std::vector` for small, fixed-size collections because of its static memory allocation and lack of dynamic resizing overhead.
   - **`std::vector`**: Offers better performance for large collections or when the size of the collection is unknown at compile time, as it can dynamically resize itself to accommodate new elements.

5. **Usage**:
   - **`std::array`**: Useful when the size of the collection is known at compile time and does not change. It's often used for small, fixed-size collections where the size is known in advance.
   - **`std::vector`**: Suitable when the size of the collection can change dynamically at runtime or when the size is not known at compile time. It's a versatile container that can be resized and is widely used in C++.

In summary, choose `std::array` when you need a fixed-size container with known size at compile time, and choose `std::vector` when you need a dynamic-size container or when the size is not known at compile time.
