I got the error message below when compiling my project. At the beginning, I had no idea what was going on. I only define the function `load_engine` once in the header file, and there is no definition elsewhere.

```log
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/main.dir/src/trt.cpp.o: in function `load_engine()':
trt.cpp:(.text+0x131): multiple definition of `load_engine()'; 
CMakeFiles/main.dir/src/main.cpp.o:main.cpp:(.text+0x0): first defined here
```

It looks like this in the header file

```c++
struct infer_params
{
    std::string weights_file; // currently supports only uff file
    int batch_size;
    std::string save_engine;
    std::string load_engine;
};

bool load_engine(){
// do something....
}
```

`load_engine` was defined with a string in the struct, and then `load_engine`was defined with a function. I could change the namings or use `inline` when define `load_engine` at the second time. As an inline function is a function defined in C++ that is expanded in place at each point in your code where it is called, rather than being called through the usual function call mechanism.
