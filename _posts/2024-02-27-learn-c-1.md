As a newbie to C++, I came across many challenges when working on a project using this versatile language. Learn by doing, these blogs are the record of practical examples I collected.

I was confused by the following line, when reading the implementation of [`logger`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/c0c633cc629cc0705f0f69359f531a192e524c0f/samples/common/logger.cpp#L30) in TensorRT samples.

```c++
LogStreamConsumer gLogFatal{LOG_FATAL(gLogger)};
```

1. `LogStreamConsumer` is a class used for handling log messages or streams.

2. `gLogFatal` is an instance of the `LogStreamConsumer` class. It is being initialized with the result of LOG_FATAL(`gLogger`).

3. `LOG_FATAL` is a inline function customize the `gLogger`

4. `gLogger` is an instance of a Logger class or object.

5. `Initialization`: The [`uniform initialization`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uniform-initialization-in-c/) syntax is used: `type var_name{arg1, arg2, ....arg n}` 

The gLogFatal object is being initialized with the result of calling LOG_FATAL with gLogger as an argument. This suggests that LOG_FATAL is constructing a LogStreamConsumer object, possibly based on the severity level of gLogger.
